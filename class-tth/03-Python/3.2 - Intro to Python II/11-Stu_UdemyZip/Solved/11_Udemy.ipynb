    "* Create a Python application that reads the data on Udemy Web Development offerings. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Then store the contents of the Title, Price, Subscriber Count, Number of Reviews, and Course Length into Python Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then zip these lists together into a single tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, write the contents of your extracted data into a CSV. Make sure to include the titles of these columns in your csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows user may get an `UnicodeDecodeError`, to avoid this file pass in `encoding=\"utf8\"` as an additional parameter when reading in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As, with many datasets, the file does not include the header line. Use the below as a guide on the columns: \"id,title,url,isPaid,price,numSubscribers,numReviews,numPublishedLectures,instructionalLevel,contentInfo,publishedTime\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the percent of subscribers that have also left a review on the course. Include this in your final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parse the string associated with course length, such that we store it as an integer instead of a string. (i.e. \"4 hours\" should be converted to 4).\n"
